# TT-GAN
This repository contains the simulation dataset and code for the journal paper "Transfer learning enabled transformer-based generative adversarial networks for modeling and generating terahertz channels". The code is based on [TransGAN](https://github.com/VITA-Group/TransGAN) and [mmwchanmod](https://github.com/nyu-wireless/mmwchanmod). Please note that there is slight difference between this journal version and conference version "Transformer-based GAN for Terahertz Spatial-Temporal Channel Modeling and Generating" in terms of data-processing steps. For example, in conference version, the phase instead of elevation angle of arrival is generated and modeled, and the AoA angle of LoS path is set as the reference angle of 0 degree.

## Data
The simulation data is provided, which can be generated by the [QuaDriGa](https://quadriga-channel-model.de/) software in the matlab with the provided statistics in the file "TWC_Indoor_Corridor_LOS.conf". 
```
matlab coeff_generation_3gpp.m
```

## Network
The T-GAN and TT-GAN are implemented in transformer-gan.py and ttgan.py respectively. The ttgan.py is fine-tuned on the pre-trained tgan models. The number of epochs is set as 10000


## Evaluation
The tt-gan are compared with the basic gan, t-gan and ray-tracing.
